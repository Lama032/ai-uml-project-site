# GitHub Pages Starter

This repository hosts a simple multi-page site that meets the course guidelines:
- Lists team members and project topic
- Organized into topics/sub-topics
- Clean, readable, accessible design
- No national IDs
- English content (Hebrew only in parentheses where required)

## Local edits

2. Upload these files to the root of that repository.
3. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set the source to the `main` branch (root).
4. Visit `https://<username>.github.io`.
